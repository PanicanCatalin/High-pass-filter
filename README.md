# High-pass-filter
A simulation of a high-pass filter using Matlab.

The high-pass filter in this simulation is composed of a resistor and a capacitor, and its electrical schematic is shown below the graph. The user can modify both the resistance (measured in ohms) and the capacitance (measured in farads). The user can change the prefix of the measurement unit for each component- kilo and mega for ohms, micro and milli for farads.

The program allows the user to simulate either real or ideal conditions for a high-pass filter as well as view both the initial signal and the signal modified by the filter. Almost all the parameters can be modified, including the frequency, amplitude, DC component, and phase of the initial signal as well as the resistance, capacitance, and the number of periods shown on the graph. The cutoff frequency and period of the signal will automatically be calculated and displayed beneath the graph.

In the bottom right corner, the user can press a button to open a new window that displays the basic characteristics of a high-pass filter in the form of Bode diagrams.

The graph updates in real time without requiring a restart after changes to the initial signal or to the starting parameters, saving time and allowing for quicker experimentation.
