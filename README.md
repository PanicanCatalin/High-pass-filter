# High-pass-filter
A simulation of a High-pass filter using Matlab

the high-pass filter in this simulation is made up of a resistance and a capacitor, the user can change the value of the resistance(measured in ohms) as well as the value of the capacitor (measured in farads) the user being able to change the prefix of the measurement unit for each component(kilo and mega for ohms, micro and mili for farads).

The program allows the user to simulate real or ideal conditions for a high pass filter as well as view both the initial signal and the signal modified by the filter, almost all the parameters can be modified including the frequency of the initial signal, the amplitude, DC component,  phase, resistance and capacitor as well as the number of periods shown on the graph.
